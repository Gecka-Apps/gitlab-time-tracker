   gnome-extensions list --enabled | grep gitlab-time-tracker
   ```
3. Check the extension logs:
   ```bash
   journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell
   ```

### Cannot select projects or issues

1. Verify your GitLab URL and token in settings
2. Ensure your token has `api` scope
3. Check your network connection
4. Verify the GitLab instance is accessible

### Time not sent to GitLab

1. Check the notification message for error details
2. Verify you have permission to add time to the issue
3. Ensure the project allows time tracking
4. Check the browser console for API errors

## Development

### Building from Source

The extension includes a Makefile for building and development:

```bash
# Build the extension package (compiles schemas and translations)
make build

# Build and install the extension
make install

# Update translation templates
make pot

# Test in nested GNOME Shell
make test-shell

# Test preferences dialog
make test-prefs

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Show all available commands
make help
```

The `build` command uses `gnome-extensions pack` which automatically:
- Compiles GSettings schemas
- Compiles translations from .po files
- Creates a .zip package in the `build/` directory
